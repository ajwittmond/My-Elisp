# My Elisp Files

## food_data.el
This file uses org.el to build and maintain an org file
for logging food.  It can download calorie and macro nutrient data
from the usda database and add it to the org file as a named table.
It can also create and maintain a table of the food eaten on a given day.
The ammount of food logged in a given entry is stored as grams.
