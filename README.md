# My Elisp Files

## food_data.el
This file uses org-elements.el  to build and maintain an org file
for logging food.  It can download calorie and macro nutrient data
from the usda database and add it to the org file as a named table.
It can also create and maintain a table of the food eaten on a given day.
The ammount of food logged in a given entry is stored as grams.

To use this simply change where food-org-file points.
